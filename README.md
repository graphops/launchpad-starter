**WARNING: Launchpad is ALPHA quality software. We are rapidly iterating to create the best UX for Indexers. Expect API-breaking changes for the next few weeks. Contributors are very welcome.**

## Introduction

Launchpad is a toolkit for running a Graph Protocol Indexer on Kubernetes. It aims to provide the fastest path to production multi-chain indexing, with sane security and performance defaults. It should work well whether you have a single node cluster or twenty. It is comprised of an opinionated set of tools on your local machine, layered over one another to provide a declarative workflow to manage your deployments stack.

There are three major components to be aware of:

1. Launchpad Starter ([`graphops/launchpad-starter`](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-starter)): A starting point for every new Launchpad deployment
2. Launchpad Charts ([`graphops/launchpad-charts`](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-charts)): A collection of Helm Charts for blockchains and web3 apps
3. Launchpad Namespaces ([`graphops/launchpad-namespaces`](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces)): A collection of preconfigured Kubernetes Namespaces using Helmfile

- A collection of Helm Charts for deploying and monitoring blockchain nodes and Graph Protocol Indexers in Kubernetes, with P2P `NodePort` support
- Preconfigured namespaces for core cluster functions (logging, monitoring, etc) and major blockchains
- An automated dependency update pipeline for [`graphops/launchpad-charts`](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-charts) and [`graphops/launchpad-namespaces`](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-namespaces)
